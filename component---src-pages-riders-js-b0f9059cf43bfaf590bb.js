In 1995 he single handidly set up the Carlisle based LLED Construction Limited who specialize in supplying directly to blue chip clients commercial and retail all trade constructional reactive maintenance services. Having built the business up from a one-man venture over the next twenty-one years he sold the company to the national construction firm Morris and Spottiswood Limited in 2016, his purpose in doing this was to enable him to retire whilst maintaining employment for his loyal and longstanding workforce, without whom he clearly identifies his business would never have been so successful. Dee remained as an employee of the new business owners until March of 2021 running his former business and also their own maintenance division for them in the capacity of operations director.
