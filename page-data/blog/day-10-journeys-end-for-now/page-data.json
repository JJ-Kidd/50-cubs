He claimed later there was no need to indicate as it was a bend in the road with a turning off &#8211; what every one else knows as a T junction. Thereafter approaching every junction he used his indicators along with assorted limbs to warn us of coming turns &#8211; total overkill drama queen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride through the Scottish boarders went Coldstream, Kelso, Jedburgh, Bonchester Bridge, Newcastleton, Cannonbie, Longtown on to Carlisle. This route is well known to all of us having been ridden many times by us albeit on slightly more powerful machines. The journey was enjoyable, but uneventful which led all three of us to reflect over the past ten days. Our thoughts were tempered with emotion as every turn of the wheels brought us closer to reaching our first iconic milestone namely the completion of leg one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this juncture we three all feel our deepest thanks need to be given to the following-</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daisy, Buttercup and Pansy for their faultless performance despite the repeated hammering all three machines received. It’s no wonder why the Honda 50 step through is the worlds most widely manufactured motorcycle, it’s well designed, endurable and reliable. Our deep thanks also go to Moff our motorcycle mechanic of choice who prepared the girls for this epic adventure before we set off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We definitely feel our deepest thanks is required to all those we have met on our travels , the friendly welcome, kindness and generosity of all has been overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our corporate and personal sponsors are most deeply thanked by us all, we are confident when all has come in that we will have raised in excess of £5000.00. Random strangers, groups of bikers, people in pubs have all come up to us and thrust cash donations into our hands all of which has been then loaded onto the GoFundMe page. For example whilst watching the fantastic England game in a Peterhead pub an old man came to Monkey and said “I don’t have much in life but you boys deserve this I’m sorry it couldn’t be more” he gave Monkey £2.30 and disappeared this made the three of us deeply emotional at the time, no girly blubbing though, just meaningful bottom lip quivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee the blog writer with immense reluctance begrudgingly feels he needs to acknowledge Monkey and Bowie’s route planning which has been faultless. Bowie’s engineering skills in crafting the lightweight Ducati pannier racks has been a godsend. Monkey’s organisational skills in generating our much needed tool kits and inventing our superb old school satnav system. Blunders aside Dee’s accommodation and ferry booking has provided us all with passage and a fine place to stay every night. Dee is particularly proud of his booking at the Lost Guest House in Peterhead where Monkey was soothingly awoken by a family chorus of seagulls living on his bedroom skylight at 0400 on day eight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><span class=\"wp-image-226 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\"

weather with only one day of rain it has made our journey so much more enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monkey and Bowie with immense irritation reluctantly feel it required to mention Dee’s tireless fundraising skills, anyone who showed the slightest passing interest in the Cubs was interrogated by him and a promotional flyer thrust in their hands. Daily he’s written the blog which was then collectively reviewed before publishing, pre-event he’s written and designed the Facebook page, set up the GoFundMe account, printed and handed out flyers and with the invaluable skill and help of his nephew Jordan Kidd who designed and established the web site has appealed to a wider audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1250 &#8211; journeys end in Carlisle was recorded for posterity by Karen Dee’s long suffering wife. Hi fives and man hugs thereafter abounded, we did it!!!.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some final facts regarding leg one, today’s mileage 96, total miles ridden on the leg 1335, collective fuel consumed by the girls 32.33 gallons at a cost of £198.00 average fuel consumption for each Cub 123.87 miles per gallon. Collective total the three Cubs have ridden 4005 which equates to £1.18 funds raised so far per mile ridden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a footnote we have decided to also incorporate the Isle of Man on our western UK leg with the sole purpose of riding the TT course. We intend to create a raffle for you all to participate in at a small cost to predict our circuit time, which will be accurately measured using a sun dial.</p>\n","date":"July 10, 2021","categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Uncategorized","slug":"uncategorized"}]},"tags":{"nodes":[]},"author":{"node":{"name":"Dee Addison","slug":"dee"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMjU="}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
